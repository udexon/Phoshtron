Phoshtron (Greek ΦΩΣ ΘΡΟΝΟΣ, _Light-Shell-Machine_) is the name of the cyber universe to be built using GLAVA (GL Actor Viewer Architecture) &mdash; inspired by the movie Tron, as well as biblical figure Metatron μετὰ θρóνος (meta thronos).

GLAVA (GL Actor Viewer Architecture) aims to be a platform independent architecture for viewing OpenGL / WebGL objects in an Actor VM (virtual machine) from Viewer VMs, that exist as independent instances in browsers, operating system processes (programs), on different physical devices in a network.


## A. Programs that are aware of time and space ....

.... software / games / simulation development with GLAVA ....

When a programmer is given a new tool, he may begin to think very differently, if this tool allows him to do something that he cannot do previously.

GLAVA is not just a three.js / WebSocket module. Consider the common programming languages and environments that most programmers are familiar with:

1. Linux bash shell; C++ programs.

2. Linux bash shell; Python programs.

3. PHP server.

4. JavaScript front end.

5. Android apps.

The programs in the environments listed above are very different from physical interactive experience of human beings &mdash; if human beings are like programs, like those in the movies Tron or Matrix, they will be interacting with other programs, based on space-time coordinates. This is exactly what GLAVA can provide.

Readers may ask,

- What differences does it make to write GLAVA programs that are aware of space-time coordinates, compared to the conventional programs as listed above?


## B. _γενηθήτω φῶς (genēthētō phōs). Fiat Lux. Let there be light._

- "Let there be light" is an English translation of the Hebrew יְהִי אוֹר‎ (yehi 'or) found in Genesis 1:3 of the Torah, the first part of the Hebrew Bible. In Old Testament translations of the phrase, translations include the Greek phrase γενηθήτω φῶς (genēthētō phōs) and the Latin phrases fiat lux and lux sit.

We may only speculate that, if there was a God, and he created light, then it must be used for Angels to communicate and see each other.

GLAVA can be thought of as the Biblical light, whether we believe in it religiously or take it as an analogy, that will enable the communications and vision in the cyber universe.

This biblical anecdote lends an interesting meaning to Phoshtron, the name of the cyber universe to be built using GLAVA.
