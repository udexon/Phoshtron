## D. The Flying Green Ball

As the old saying goes, "a picture is worth a thousand words".

- GLAVA Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJuAKE0al7w

More than just a picture, an animated example of a flying green ball is worth perhaps ten thousand words.

As a programmer, we may think, "what functions can I write to make the current GLAVA demo more interesting?"

### I. From 1AnV to nAnV

1. Enhancements from 1AnV to nAnV

1AnV means "one Actor multiple Viewers".

nAnV means "multiple Actors multiple Viewers".

In the current GLAVA demo, Actor-A sends the states of the green ball to Viewer-B.

In VM-B (virtual Machine B), we have not created an Actor yet, or rather, we have no created new objects that can be viewed in VM-A (virtual machine A). In this case, virtual machines are the three.js objects created in each browser tab.

2. _Can we create another ball in VM-B, let the green ball in VM-A collide, and see what happen next?_
