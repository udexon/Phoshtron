## D. The Flying Green Ball

As the old saying goes, "a picture is worth a thousand words".

- GLAVA Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJuAKE0al7w

More than just a picture, an animated example of a flying green ball is worth perhaps ten thousand words.

As a programmer, we may think, "what functions can I write to make the current GLAVA demo more interesting?"

### I. From 1AnV to nAnV

1. Enhancements from 1AnV to nAnV

1AnV means "one Actor multiple Viewers".

nAnV means "multiple Actors multiple Viewers".

In the current GLAVA demo, Actor-A sends the states of the green ball to Viewer-B.

In VM-B (virtual Machine B), we have not created an Actor yet, or rather, we have no created new objects that can be viewed in VM-A (virtual machine A). In this case, virtual machines are the three.js objects created in each browser tab.

2. _Can we create another ball in VM-B, let the green ball in VM-A collide, and see what happen next?_

Computer graphics and physics simulations have improved leaps and bounds and become uniquitous commodities since the days of Silicon Graphics machines until today's GPU on mobile phones.

GLAVA might just be the last mile needed to creaet a universal games engine &mdash; independent of platforms (Omniequivalent on HAO) and as easy to program as Logo and (Lotus) 1-2-3.

Literally hundreds of past 3D graphics and physics simulation projects from Open Dynamics Engine, Bullet, to three.js and ammo.js can be replicated or ported easily to GLAVA now, as we have demostrated the fundamental principles of interactions between a Viewer and an Actor using three.js and WebSocket. All that are needed now are publicity, awareness and interests to participate from young programmers.

So implementing a simple collision demo in GLAVA would be the next milestone &mdash; let's see if we can get enough man power to do it by 31st December 2020 ???
