- Programs that are aware of "self, others and the environment".

A human child learns to break down and construct objects around him (her) one piece at a time.

Many would have experience playing with Lego or similar toys.

The current generation of children would have come across 3D online computer games, before they pick up programming languages.

Today, it is most likely for very young programmers to encounter their first programming experience in Android Java, Windows Python or Web JavaScript.

What programs would a prodigious 15 years old in 2021 write?

It is very likely that he would pick up one of the many popular games engines and begin working on the next proprietary or open source online 3D game.

So, what are the pitfalls for young programmers today when they pick up games development using any of today's popular games engines, compared to GLAVA?

The answer is summarized in 3 letters:

- H: Homoiconic
- A: Autoaddressing
- O: Omniequivalent

Incidentally, HAO means good 好 in Chinese.

By the principle of omniequivalence, it means that GLAVA can be implemented in any existing games engine that they are working on, as GLAVA is implemented using Phoscript, a Forth like reverse polish notation metaprogramming script that be implemented easily on any know programming language or platform.

In addition, Phoscript has the benefits of "sandwich API", allowing beginners to start code in Phoscript quickly, while letting senior coders write Phoscript interface libraries to the host programming language or platform. 

This means conservatively speaking, 2 to 10 times more young programmers may be able to pick up online 3D games programming compared to those in the year 2020, as Phoscript GLAVA lowers the barriers of entry.

Besides, as GLAVA becomes a compatibility interface between existing games engines, this will lead to the emergence of Phoshtron, literally a universal games and simulation platform.

However, from the perspectives of a small number of programmers in the Phoshtron project currently (less than 10), what are the primary differences between GLAVA to conventional programming?

The answers is that, with GLAVA, a programmer can start thinking about "self, others and environment" with respect to the programs that he (she) is writing. i.e. Instead of thinking like a web programmer, whose mind is preoccupied with questions like "how should my web app response to user interactions?", he may ask "what functions can I write to respond to the flying green ball?"

_GLAVA makes it much easier to start work on online 3D games programming, much like how a child would play Lego, quite literally._

_Imagine the benefits this will bring to current generation of teenagers ...._

_They will grow up to be a new generation of programmers or non-programmers, capable of using computer algebra (through learning Phoscript GLAVA) in their work and life in 2030, much like how personal computers, spreadsheets and Windows transformed the previous generation._
